# T-rax-game
A MonoGame remake of Google's Chrome Dino game! ðŸ¦– 

This is my first attempt of programming a 2D game and also the first time using MonoGame with C#. 
Everything feels fresh and interesting. I can not wait anymore to explore this brand-new world! XD

## Update Timeline

### 2025.02.25

#### Updating
Prototype finished. Basic functions, including movements, speed accelaration, score tracking and barrier generation has been fulfilled.

#### NEED TO DO
- Collision detection accuracy improvement
    - The hit boxes of barrier as well as T-rax were too large to provide accurate boundary for collision detection.
- The UI designation of game start and game over.
    - Design a simple UI for game start frame and game over frame.
- score tracking process need to be improved.
    - The score tracking now is somehow unsatisfied.
- Revising variable names.  
    - Some variable names are confused which need to be renamed.
- ï¼ˆIf necessaryï¼‰Reconstruction methods.
    - Some Parameters of methods are unnecessary or unstructured.

### 2025.03.04

#### updating 
Last version the collision detection method is simply AABB detection. Enhancing the accuracy with pixel-level detection after AABB detection.
